            <br><br><b>Information automatically collected</b>
            <br><br>
            <b>In Short:</b> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser, and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Website.
            <br><br>
            We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Website. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser, and device
            characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Website and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
            <br><br>
            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our Cookie Notice: http://www.aramean.insititute/cookies.
            <br><br>
            The information we collect includes:

            </ul>

                    which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
                    settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, we may use GPS and other
                    technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                    address). You can opt-out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note, however, if you choose to opt-out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

            share your personal information (see "<a href="#infoshare">Will your information be shared with anyone?</a>" above), in and other countries.
            <br><br>
            If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country.

            <br>
            <b>In Short:</b> We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.
            <br><br>
            The Website may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services, or mobile applications.
            We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of the data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Website.
            You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than 2 years.
            <br><br>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div id="infosafe" class="fdc mt2">
            <h4>8. How do we keep your information safe?</h4>

            <br><br>
            We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
            Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.

            By using the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Website.

            <h4>11. Controls for Do Not Track features</h4>
            <br>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
            online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
            choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
