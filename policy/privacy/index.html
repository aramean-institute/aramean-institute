            <b>In Short:</b> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Website.
            <br><br><br>
            We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Website . This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device
            characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Website and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
            <br><br><br>
            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our Cookie Notice: http://www.aramean.insititute/cookies.
            <br><br><br>
            The information we collect includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and
                    performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Website and
                    which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your
                    IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the
                    Website (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches
                    and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system
                    activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).</li>

            <ul>

            </ul>

                <li>Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location,
                    which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
                    settings of the device you use to access the Website . For example, we may use GPS and other
                    technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                    address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to
                    the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to
                    opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

            If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not
