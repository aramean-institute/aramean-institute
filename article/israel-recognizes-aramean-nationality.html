        <p class="fwb">A significant and historical event: Israel is the first country in the world to acknowledge Aramean minoritiy living in Israel as a distinct ethnicity.</p>
        <p>Several scholars consulted with the Ministry of Interior before making the announcement, and based on their advice Minister Gideon Sa'ar ruled that "the presence of the Aramean nation is evident."</p>
        <br>
        <p>The historical heritage, religion, culture, origin and shared language met the conditions of proving the existince of the Aramean nation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In December 2014, the Registration and Passports Section of the Population and Immigration Authority published its guidelines on the subject, whose provision permits Arameans to claim their identities.</p>
