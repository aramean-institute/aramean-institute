        <p class="fwb">The Bible reveals that Arameans and the Hebrew Patriarchs have shared origins and marriage ties existed between the peoples.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Both Arameans and Hebrews (Israelites) are a Semitic race tracing their lineage back to Shem, son of Noah, but what ties their bound even stronger is Aram, son of Shem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Aram, the son of Shem, played a role in forming many nations and spreading his offsprings in the Middle East. He is regarded as being the ancestor of the Arameans and the Jewish people.</p>
