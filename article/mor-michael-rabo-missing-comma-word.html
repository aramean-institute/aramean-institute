    <article class="mt2">
        <p>Theologian Jean-Baptiste Chabot's first edition of his interpretation of the Chronicle of Michael the Great<sup>[1]</sup> lacked a comma and left out "Arameans" in the sentence when he didn't correct the known errors in the Edessan-Aleppo codex manuscript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During the copying process, the Aramaic-Syriac manuscript of the Edessan-Aleppo codex was corrupted. Instead of correcting the errors in his work, Chabot passed them on, and the sentence became "Othuroye d-henun Suryoye", which means "Assyrians are Syriacs.". An untrue statement.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As it appears in the first edition, the heading says "Shmohe d-'ame d-ith l-hun sefro d-men bnayo d-Shim", meaning "Semitic people descendants of Shem", but no mentions of "Aram" being one of Shem's sons in the subheading, however reading further on page 11, it says: "Bnay Shim: Othuroye, Kaldoye, Ludoye, Oromoye d-henun Suryoye, Ebroye, Forsoye", meaning "Children of Shem: Assyrians, Chaldeans, Lydians, Arameans that is Syriacs, Hebrews, and Persians."</p>
        <br>
        <p>The error resulted went viral online for years and confused many Arameans around the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks to Fr. Dayroyo Isa Aygür, Mushe Görgün, Steffanos Budak, Iskender Demirel, Eliyo Seven Beth Qemez, and Gabriel Yalgin, the error was corrected in a new edition of the Chronicle (Ktābā d-Maktbānút zabne)<sup>[2]</sup> that was published 2006.</p>
