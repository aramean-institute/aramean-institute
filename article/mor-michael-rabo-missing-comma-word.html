    <article class="mt2">
        <p>When Theologian Jean Baptist Chabot released the first edition of his interpretation of The Chronicles of Michael Rabo, he failed to add a comma and the word "Oromoye" to the sentence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The error result went viral online for years and confused many Arameans when it claimed "Othuroye D-henun Suryoye", meaning "Assyrians are Syriacs".</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the first edition, it is clear that it says "Shmohe d-'ame d-ith l-hun sefro d-men bnayo d-Shim", in the subheading but nothing about "Oromoye" in the body text. When reading further on page 11, it reads: "Bnay Shim: Othuroye, Kaldoye, Ludoye, Oromoye D-henun Suryoye, Ebroye, Forsoye"</p>
        <br>
        <p>The error was corrected in 2006 in a new edition which was published with the correct interpretation, thanks to Dayroyo Isa Aygur, Mushe GÃ¶rgun, Steffanos Budak, Iskender Demirel, Eliyo Seven beth Qemez and Gabriel Yalgin.</p>
