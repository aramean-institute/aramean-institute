        <p class="fwb">The Bible reveals that Arameans and the Hebrew Patriarchs have shared origins and marriage ties existed between the peoples.</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the Bible, there were ongoing rivalries between Israel and its neighboring Aramean kingdoms, but there were also relations of trade and family between them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As Semitic races, both Arameans and Hebrews (Israelites) trace their lineage back to Shem, son of Noah. But what ties them even closer is Aram, son of Shem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shem's son Aram played a key role in the creation of many nations across the Middle East and is believed to be the ancestor of both the Arameans and the Hebrews.</p>
