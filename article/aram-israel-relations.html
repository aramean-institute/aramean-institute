        <p class="fwb">The Bible reveals that Arameans and the Hebrew Patriarchs have shared origins and marriage ties existed between the peoples.</p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the Bible, there were ongoing rivalries between Israel and its neighboring Aramean kingdoms, but there were also relations of trade and family between them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As Semitic races, both Arameans and Hebrews (Israelites) trace their lineage back to Shem, son of Noah. But what ties them even closer is Aram, son of Shem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shem's son Aram played a key role in the creation of many nations across the Middle East and is believed to be the ancestor of both the Arameans and the Hebrews.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Jacob who later became Israel, was forbidden by his father Isaac to marry a Canaanite woman, so he was commanded to marry Leah and Rachel<sup>[1]</sup>, both Aramean daughters of Laban. His mother, Rebecka was an Aramean. His maternal grandfather Bethuel is called Aramean<sup>[2]</sup> and so is his uncle Laban<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
