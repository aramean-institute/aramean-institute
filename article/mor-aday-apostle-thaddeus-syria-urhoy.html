        <p>Jesus sent Apostle Thaddeus to convert Arameans in Syria and to heal their King.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the Gospels, Jesus Christ's fame spread far and wide so that sick people from as far away as Syria came to Jesus to be healed (Matthew 4:24).</p>
        <br>
        <p>An Aramean king named Abgar Ukama, who ruled over the city-state of Urhoy (Edessa), sent messengers to Jesus with the hope of being healed (John 12:20-24).</p>
        <br>
        <p>They arrived days before Jesus was crucified. Those messengers were promised by Jesus that he would send one of his disciples to Urhoy (Edessa) to heal the king.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During the time immediately following the resurrection, Thomas, inspired by Holy Spirit, sent Thaddeus to Urhoy (Edessa), to preach the Good News taught by Jesus Christ, and to heal their King.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thaddeus preached to the Arameans in Syria and they believed and were converted, and the King was healed as well.
