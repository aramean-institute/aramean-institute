            "question": "Why do Arameans call themselves Chaldeans or Assyrians?",
            "answer": "During the Colonization of the Middle East, which started in the 16th century, groups of Arameans pledged alliances to Westerners and accepted the transformation of the new Middle East, in the hope of being independent, safe, and protected. The terms Assyrian and Chaldean were chosen accordingly to the geographical location of the Assyrian and Babylonian provinces. The Syriac Churches of the East and the national separatist movements propagated the new identities amongst the people and created bogus ethnologies."
