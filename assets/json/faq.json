            "question": "Why do Arameans call themselves Chaldeans or Assyrians?",
            "answer": "During the colonization of the Middle East, which started in the 16th century, groups of Arameans pledged alliances to Westerners and accepted the transformation of the new Middle East, in hope of stabilizing the region. The terms Assyrian and Chaldean were chosen according to the geographical location of the Assyrian and Babylonian provinces. The Syriac Churches of the East and the national separatist movements propagated bogus ethnologies amongst the people, still used until today."
